# Bill of Materials - Self-Watering Plant System

This document lists all components required to build the self-watering plant system using the Pearson littleBits STEM Invention Toolbox.

## littleBits Modules
| Quantity | Module | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Power | 9V battery & cable; provides power to the circuit |
| 1 | Moisture Sensor | Detects soil moisture level (analog) |
| 1 | Threshold | Sets a trigger level for the moisture sensor |
| 1 | Inverter | Reverses logic (optional for certain configurations) |
| 1 | LED | Visual indicator for system status (e.g., watering active) |
| 1 | Servo | Controls a small water pump or valve (if using servo-driven pump) |
| 1 | Wire | Extra bitSnaps for extending connections |

## Additional Electronics & Hardware
| Quantity | Item | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Micro submersible water pump (3‑5V) | Pumps water from reservoir to plant |
| 1 | Vinyl tubing (approx. 30 cm) | Transfers water from pump to plant pot |
| 1 | Small water container (≥ 500 ml) | Reservoir for water |
| 1 | Plant pot with drainage hole | Holds the plant and soil |
| 1 | Bag of potting soil | For the plant |
| 1 | Small houseplant (e.g., succulent, herb) | The plant to be watered |
| 2 | AA batteries (if using battery holder) | Alternative power for pump |
| 1 | Battery holder with wires | To power the pump separately |
| 5 | Jumper wires (male‑to‑male) | Connect littleBits to external pump |
| 1 | Breadboard (optional) | For easier wiring |

## Tools & Consumables
| Quantity | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | Screwdriver (small) | For tightening terminals |
| 1 | Scissors | Cutting tubing |
| 1 | Hot glue gun or strong tape | Securing components |
| 1 | Ruler/measuring tape | Measuring tubing length |
| 1 | Marker pen | Labeling parts |

## Optional / Alternative Parts
- **Arduino bit** – if you want to program custom logic.
- **USB power adapter** – instead of 9V battery for longer operation.
- **Relay module** – if the pump requires higher voltage.
- **Moisture sensor calibration kit** – for precise calibration.

## Safety Notes
- Ensure all electrical connections are dry before powering on.
- Use a waterproof container for the water reservoir to avoid spills.
- Do not submerge littleBits modules in water.
- Supervise students when using tools and electrical components.
