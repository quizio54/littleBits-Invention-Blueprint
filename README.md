# littleBits Self-Watering Plant System - Invention Blueprint

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive, reproducible invention blueprint for a **self-watering plant system** using the Pearson littleBits STEM Invention Toolbox. The project is designed for middle school to high school students (grades 6-12) and educators looking to integrate hands-on STEM learning with real-world problem solving.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic electronic circuits and sensors
- Learn about automation and feedback loops
- Develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills
- Practice technical documentation and project management

## Target Audience
- **STEM Teachers** looking for ready-to-use project guides
- **Students** who want to build a functional invention
- **Makers and Hobbyists** interested in littleBits projects
- **Educators** seeking interdisciplinary connections (biology, engineering, computer science)

## Invention Purpose
The self-watering plant system automatically monitors soil moisture and waters the plant when needed, ensuring optimal hydration without manual intervention. This project demonstrates:
- **Sensor input** (moisture sensor)
- **Logic processing** (threshold detection)
- **Actuator output** (water pump)
- **System feedback** (LED indicator)

## Repository Structure
This blueprint is organized into the following sections:
1. **Bill of Materials** – List of all littleBits modules and additional components
2. **Assembly Instructions** – Step-by-step physical construction guide
3. **Circuit Logic & Code** – Explanation of electronic connections and any programming
4. **Testing & Troubleshooting** – Validation steps and common issues

## Getting Started
